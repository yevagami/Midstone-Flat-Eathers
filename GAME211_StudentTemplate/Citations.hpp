//	how to remove elements from vectors - from Gail

//	object pools for projectiles - from Gail
//		"extremely effective for projectiles." "the essence of the idea described in this page is you create a bunch of instances of your projectiles, but dont start showing them yet"
//		"instead of asking the heap to create the new projectile, ask a structure we create to "make this projectile live". we manage it, rather than the heap"
//		"makes it easier for them appear and reappear"
//		"object pools take care of the vectors, removing from vectors while looping, etc" - you arent really removing it, just changing its state to not-live"
